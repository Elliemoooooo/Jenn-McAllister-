Haunted by lingering questions as Americans take one long look in the mirror and do not like what they see. They look at their choices for president and are not impressed. Trump’s gilded nostalgia vs. Castro’s vision of aesthetic change and renewed unity. The pandemic has altered how many people interact with each other. The protests have made it impossible to look away from the carnage. The economic strain has left voters at their wits' end.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Donald Trump, ever defiant, ignores the warning signs and provides red meat to his loyal base with his bombastic, carnival-style rallies, frothing at the mouth about law & order, promising a triumphant recovery, and dismissing critics as enemies of the nation. For four years he’s taken a blowtorch to a wide array of issues, with grandiose bombasticity and fleeting concentration. Covid-19 provided the administration with an opportunity to define itself beyond the endless cacophony of noise and misery.\n\n\n\n</li>\n\n\n\n<li>Castro, meanwhile, embodies — or at least attempts to embody — the hope of a younger, more diverse generation. At 46 years of age, his message of compassion, reform, and inclusion strikes a chord with young Americans begging for any reason not to check out of politics.</li></ul>\n\n\nAs November nears, the air around Washington thickens. Both men are captured by their own ambition and belief that only they can rescue the nation from the depths of despair it wallows in. Will sanity be restored, or will the self-styled king, the 45th president, reign supreme once more?</p></div>",

Once seen as a rising star of the party, the avatar of their desires to turn the deep red state of Texas bright blue, his early campaign struggled to gain traction against better-known, more seasoned rivals. Yet, through persistence, weathering the constant polling shifts, and maintaining a disciplined message not augmented to fit a passing fad, Castro emerged battered, but proudly the nominee of a party in search of more than just victory this November.</p>\n\nBut this is politics. You do not advance without making more than a few enemies. Castro’s service is thin, making his ideology vague which can be an asset. He can define himself as a moderate, in the vein of stable, recognizable hand at the wheel many Americans yearn for after four-years of living in Trump’s mind palace of absurdity. He can look leftward and clasps his arms around Bernie Sanders and say if this is truly the last election, then let us stand for something before the lights go out.",
